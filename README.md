# Logistic_Regression
To Predict the heart attack disease for organisation(WHO:World health organisation)Using machine learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will increasing manner or decreasing manner.
Problem Statement:

A World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 12 millions then records.One of them half of the dead result is found in US.The research scholar point out the most relevant risk factor of As a data science Engineering predict the overall risk using Machine Learning algorith called as Logistic Regression.

TASK-1: Import the libraries which is required for prediction.

TASK-2: Import the dataset using work space.

TASK-3: Use a appropriate argument of sklearn library to train,test and split the data sets.

TASK-4: fit your values with arrange function with feature scalling.

TASK-5: check your model accuracy and precition using confution matrix
